After living out countless scenes of repetition,
Our main protagonist was ready to face the
Nameless Horror.
On that fateful day,
Our main protagonist stepped out of his apartment
And into a new world of possibility.
A new world of potential.
A less mundane world.
He checked his phone
And sure enough, it was Monday again.
It was good to be back.
