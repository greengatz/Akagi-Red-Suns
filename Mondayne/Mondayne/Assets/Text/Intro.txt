Every morning, our protagonist gets up in the morning to go to work. 
He turns off his alarm.
Goes to the bathroom and uses the toilet.
Brushes his teeth.
Feeds his dog.
Brews his coffee.
Grabs his eggs from the fridge and cooks them.
Grabs his keys.
Then heads to work.
What a beautiful morning RITUAL!
