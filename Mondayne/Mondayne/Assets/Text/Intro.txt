Every morning, our protagonist gets up in the morning to go to work. 
He turns off his alarm.
Goes to the bathroom and uses the toilet.
Takes a shower.
Brushes his teeth.
Feeds his dog.
Brews his coffee.
Grabs his eggs from the fridge and cooks them.
Then heads to work.
What a beautiful morning RITUAL!
